		<p id="action-message">The simple hand game Rock, Paper, Scissors has several names and variations. It's a game that's played all over the world and is frequently utilized to make judgments. It is even played for sport in some circumstances. Competing players must use one hand to form one of three forms at a predetermined time, according to the rules. The game is won by the player who plays the most powerful "item." <br><br>
•	Each object triumphs over one shape while losing to another. For example, rock "crushes" scissors but is "covered" by paper, paper "covers" rock but is "cut" by scissors, and scissors "cuts" paper but is "crushed" by rock. It's a tie if both players throw the same object. In this case, simply play again until a clear winner emerges.<br><br>
• 	The loser of the game has the option to choose "best two out of three," which means three rounds     will be played instead of one. As a result, the losing player has a chance to win.<br><br>
Characteristics:<br><br>
Website design that is both trendy and appealing. Layout that is easy to use and Responsive The colour of the buttons changes as the game progresses.<br><br>
The player competes against the computer, which makes random selections; the game is played in a best-of-three format, and the player receives 100 points for a winning streak.</p>
